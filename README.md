# Pong_Multiplayer

A simple Pong game I developed in my spare time using the Netcode For Gameobjects package along with the Lobby and Relay services. This game was created as an exercise to learn and apply the basics of multiplayer game development, and it employs a physics-based architecture with a Client Authoritative approach. I aimed to build a comprehensive lobby system using the Lobby service and enabled different players to play together in a Server-Client environment using the Relay service with DTLS encryption.
